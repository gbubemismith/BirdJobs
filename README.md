# BirdJobs
An application that aggregates tech jobs posted on twitter

----------------------------------------------
The project has two applications. There is a BirdJobs-SPA and BirdJobs-Api

# **BIRDJOBS-API**
 It's written completely in c# dotnet core 3.1. The BirdJobs Api has a controller to sign in to twitter using the 3 legged authentication API.
 
 I also used twitter's search API to get tech jobs posted on twitter using a defined query.
 
 This project can be cloned and ran with dotnet run.
 
 # **BIRDJOBS-SPA**
 SPA application written using Angular 8 framework and typescript. It bascially consumes the APIs written in the BirdJobs-API project.
 
 Use npm install to install all node modules used in the project and run with ng serve.
 
 Thank you.
